This repository contains the data, code, and outputs from a split-split plot randomized complete block design with repeated measures. The goal was determine the how mineral nutrients change over time in the leaves in response to foliar applications during fruit growth using leaf sap analysis.  
Also, sufficiency ranges are compared with the averages of macro- and micro-nutrients obtained from leaf sap at four different time points during preharvest.
